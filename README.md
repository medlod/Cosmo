You need to host a bot yourself or use a VPS or any service to host it.
Some Free Ones Are:
<br> <a href="https://glitch.com/"> Glitch </a>
<br> <a href="https://repl.it/~"> Repl </a>
<br> <a href="https://falixnodes.net/"> Falixnodes </a>

After you have gotten yourself a host you need to Install the following to make it work!
<br> <b> Node.js 12+ </b>
<br> NPM Package <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/discordbot-script"> discordbot-script </a>

You can install the npm package by
<br> <b> npm install (names) </b>

After this just add your bot token in the main file and start the hosting as using the index.js file as your main and your good to go!
